# Self-driving-robot

This robot was a group project made by ryan yee, dan gueco, callum, and Matthew yip. 
This was created in our first year of engineering.
Its a self driving robot that is coded to follow a white line-based track.
This video was made in 2018, props to Ryan yee for the video.

It is completely autonomous. So the moment it gets layed onto the ground, it will do everything on its own.
Basically The camera in the front will act as the sensor. If it sees black it will goto white. If it sees white it will continously follow it.
